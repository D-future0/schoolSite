<h2 style="text-align: center;">Health & Wellness</h2>
<p class="text">Students are attending a school that not only teaches them about global health, but also about how to get well. Whether it is through meals, classes or visits with nurses during recess, Creek's high school offers students the tools they need to recover from their illness or injury.The school provides students with access to a variety of medical services, including medical building hours, independent doctor visits and weekend clinic visits. Based on this experience, we can draw some conclusions about the importance of health promotion.</p>
<p class="text">The School physical education, electives and athletics all give students a competitive edge in the market.  Students who participate in these activities develop strength, endurance and skill that will serve them well in future endeavors.  Students in the School are constantly challenged by our supportive staff and their peers in an atmosphere of encouragement.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">YouthHub</h2>
<p class="text">YouthHUB is a trauma-informed, peer-led support system for youth who have experienced sexualized violence or teen dating violence. By connecting youth in crisis to community-based resources, we empower them to help themselves. We believe that in order to heal, we must go upstream: look at the root causes of the issue, acknowledge and challenge stigma, educate ourselves and others around us, and hold ourselves accountable to practice our values.</p>
