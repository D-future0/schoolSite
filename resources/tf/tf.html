<h2 style="text-align: center;">Transportation</h2>
<p class="text">Bus transportation to and from school is provided for all students who live beyond the walking distance.  Regulations have been established to govern bus usage in order to avoid disruptions in transportation or school schedules, to prevent unnecessary damage or wear to the vehicles and most importantly to protect student's health and safety.  Parents and students are urged to review all of the following regulations carefully.  Buses are operated for the convenience and protection of students, and they are expected to observe all regulations if they wish to maintain bus riding privileges.</p>
<p class="text">The ride to school can set the tone for the whole day for your child.  You can take comfort in knowing that the school bus is the safest form of transportation to school.  Our bus drivers are highly skilled drivers who undergo continual training and schooling to keep them updated to make your child's ride a safe one.  Your child's safety is of the utmost importance to our Transportation Staff.</p>
